# Supplementary Pseudocode for Main Paper

This repository contains the main pseudocode routines referenced in our paper. The purpose of this material is to support reproducibility and transparency of the methods described in the article.


In addition to the pseudocode, this repository also contains the **problem instances used in the computational experiments** presented in the paper. These instances are provided to facilitate replication of the results and further comparison in future research.

These resources are provided in a clear and self-contained format to help readers and reviewers better understand the computational aspects of the proposed approach.

Feel free to open an issue or contact the authors for clarifications.
