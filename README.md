The file `Supplementary_Material` contains the supplementary material of the paper *"Mathematical models for the one-dimensional cutting stock problem with setups and open stacks"*.

- In **Cutting Patterns**, we include the patterns generated for Formulation 1.

- In **Complete Results**, we include the complete results containing all the solutions found.

- In **Supplementary Material**, we include remarks on the usage of the proposed approaches in the CSP-S and CS-LOSP, additional details on the implementation of Algorithm 2, special cases of the CSP-SOS, and the proofs of the propositions presented in the paper.

- In **Instance Files**, we provide all problem instances used in the computational experiments to support reproducibility and future comparisons.
